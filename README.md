## Where to begin

Start with creating tests (and running!) for FixedSizeArrayList.

Once your group feels you've sufficiently covered FixedSizeArrayList
move to LoanApprovalSystem.

If there is still time left, move on to ECommerceOrderProcessor.

For all of the classes, one example test has been written. For the
sake of simplicity, let's keep all tests for one class in one file today.
